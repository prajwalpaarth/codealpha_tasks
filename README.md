🧩 CodeAlpha Hangman Game

Domain: Python Programming Internship
Intern: Parth Moholkar
Organization: CodeAlpha

📜 Project Overview

This is a simple text-based Hangman Game built in Python as part of the CodeAlpha Internship Program.
The program selects a random word from a predefined list, and the player must guess the word one letter at a time.
Incorrect guesses are limited to six chances.

🧠 Key Python Concepts Used

random module

while loops

Conditional statements (if-else)

String and list manipulation

User input handling

⚙️ How It Works

The program picks a random word from a list.

The player guesses letters one by one.

Each wrong guess brings the player closer to losing.

The game ends when the player guesses all letters correctly or runs out of chances.

To play, simply run the file:

python hangman.py
